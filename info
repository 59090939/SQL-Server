Model 

Database Files,The data files are categorized into two types: Master Data File and Secondary Data File(s). Only one Master Data File is possible for each database, and it keeps track of all the other files in the database. By convention, the Master Data File has the .mdf extension and the secondary files have .ndf.
For the log files, the extension is .ldf. Each database must have at least one.

MDF File Format 
File Structure   A MDF file has the following data structure.

Page 0: Header
Page 1: First PFS
Page 2: First GAM
Page 3: First SGAM
Page 4: Unused
Page 5: Unused
Page 6: First DCM
Page 7: First BCM

File Header 
The page number 0 of all the files contains a header that stores metadata about the file.

Page Free Space (PFS) 
PFS identifies the allocation status and determines the amount of free space.

Bit 1: Indicates whether the page is allocated or not.
Bit 2: Indicates if the page is from a mixed extent.
Bit 3: Indicates that this page is an IAM page.
Bit 4: Indicates that this page contains ghost records
Bits 5 to 7: A combined three-bit value, which indicate the page fullness as follows:
0: The page is empty
1: The page is 1–50% full
2: The page is 51–80% full
3: The page is 81–95% full
4: The page is 96–100% full
